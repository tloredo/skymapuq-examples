    <title>SkyMapUQ Example Results</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This site hosts example results from use of the <code>SkyMapUQ</code> package for computing basic uncertainty quantifications summarizing posterior PDF sky maps reported as HEALPix maps.
</p>

<p>
The current example results are from <em>preliminary</em> calculations using data from the Gravitation Wave Open Science Center's Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog, specifically the list of 93 "confident" events from the LIGO/Virgo O1 to O3 observing runs.  The calculations presented here used two maps for each of 81 GWTC events that have data from two waveform models, IMR and SEO.
</p>

Two collections of results are available:
<ul>
	<li><a href="map_uq_png/GWTC-confident-SkyMapUQ.html">Sky maps and uncertainty quantifications</a> for each event (for both IMR and SEO fit results).</li>
	<li><a href="">Scatterplots and histograms</a> of uncertainty quantifications.</li>
</ul>
